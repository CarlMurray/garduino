Arduino Hydroponics System - 3rd Year Product Design Project

The C++ program runs on an Arduino and uses a soil moisture sensor placed in a plant pot to detect when the plant needs water. The water level sensor along with the GSM module sends the user an SMS message when the water level is low and needs to be refilled, or when the plant isn't getting enough light, as measured by the built-in LDR.
